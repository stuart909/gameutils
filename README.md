This directory contains a set of game utilities that were written for various games for the purpose of modding.

The card creator was a utility that I wrote that made game cards for a Savage Worlds game night.  The card generator works, but you need the data set and images.  It creates the card deck based off of the Freedom Squadron license.  Considering that the deck is near official, I will not be uploading the data set that I used or the images I wanted.  You will have to make your own dataset and download your own images, buy the Freedom Squadron book, and learn how to make your own card set.













I will find and upload additional utilities when time permits.  Probably never if nobody asks.

Games:
- Supreme Ruler 2020
- Savage Worlds Freedom Squadron


TODO

- Space Engineers (C# scripts)
- Victoria II (event logic)
- Crusader Kings III (event logic)
- EU IV (event logic)
