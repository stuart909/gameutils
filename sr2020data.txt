SR2020data.py is a game file editing utility for the videogame SR2020 and its DLC.  I have created a program that can parse the game data from CSV format into SQLite.
I can then use pythonic sqlite commands to select and edit data, then save the data back to the game files.  This is not a GUI.  This is command line and requires
Python and SQL knowledge to edit files.

While playing this game, I found many errors in the unit data and wanted to implement my own modifications.  Manually editing gigantic CSV files is very taxing and
the smallest error will break the game data.  So I created a python program to handle the data and nicely marry the information into a temporary database that can
more easily be edited by a knowledgable DBA / Python programmer.  I handle data manipulation through the IDLE utility.


example:
\\ After the database object is loaded and instantiated as d:

d = u.pull(u.search('Conscript',u.name,u.id),u.id)
d[0][u.name]='Infantry'
d[0]['(YearAvail - 1900)']='43'
d[0]['TechReq1']='1313'

d = u.search('Militia II',u.name,u.id)
d = u.pull(d,u.id)
d[0]['TechReq1']='1313'
d[0]['TechReq2']='1598'
d[0][u.name]='Infantry'
d[0]['(YearAvail - 1900)']='46'
